# :snake: SnakeGame
Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project is a modern take on the classic arcade game that has entertained generations of gamers. Whether you are a novice looking to understand the basics of game development or an experienced developer seeking a nostalgic project, this repository provides a comprehensive and fun approach to building a Snake game from scratch.
